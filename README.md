# Scrolling Display on Raspberry Pi Sense HAT

This project creates a simple scrolling display using the Raspberry Pi Sense HAT LED matrix.
It displays my initials on the 8×8 LED grid and allows movement and interaction using the Sense HAT joystick.

The goal of this project was to explore low-level control of the LED framebuffer and hardware input handling in C.

## What It Does

Displays 'AR' on the Sense HAT 8×8 LED matrix

Scrolls the display smoothly across the screen

Uses joystick input to control movement and interaction

Clears and redraws the framebuffer each update to create animation
